## Who I Am/ Background

    Iâ€™m Kyle Dacones, a hobbyist trying to take something that I enjoy turn into something that translates into professional opportunities. A huge departure from past choices. Iâ€™m currently learning to be patient and let my natural interests and passions drive my learning/professional development. 

### What Fuels Me

    I have a pretty weird set of interests that haven't presented me with a pathway for a career utilizing them with my work:

        - Public Policy/Law
        - Data Management
        - Data Engineering/Data Analysis
        - Social Justice 
        - Open Data for Constituents
        - A Desire to Give Back to My Community
