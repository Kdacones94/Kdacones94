## Who I Am/ Background

I’m Kyle Dacones, a hobbyist trying to take something that I enjoy turn into something that translates into professional opportunities. 

A huge departure from past choices. I’m currently learning to be patient and let my natural interests and passions drive my learning/professional development. 


### What Fuels Me

I have a pretty weird set of interests that haven't presented me with a pathway for a career utilizing them with my work:

 - Public Policy/Law
 - Data Management
 - Data Engineering/Data Analysis
 - Restorative Justice 
 - Open Data for Constituents
 - A Desire to Give Back to My Community

Outside of that I am eager to start to change my relationship with open source development by going from consuming the incredible free tools and resources to maintaining and contributing to those same tools.
